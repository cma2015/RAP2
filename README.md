## easyMF
- easyMF is designed to provide an easily accessible large-scale transcriptomic data analysis platform to help botanists even with little bioinformatics background completing complicated processing with terminal-based applications that are not user-friendly. It smoothly integrated the TAMF tools into Galaxy scientific analysis platform to provide web-based, easy-to-use and thoroughly tested tools enable users perfom comparative analysis. By integrating three major matrix factorization algorithms (PCA [principle component analysis]; ICA [independent component analysis]; NMF [non-negative matrix factorization]), TAMF enables users perform a series of analysis based on pattern matrix (PM) and amplitude matrix (AM). For PM-based deep mining, four sub-modules are implemented to perform **Clustering analysis** (automatically), **Spatial transcriptome analysis** (illuminate the spatial dependency of sampled regions/voxels), and **Temporal transcriptome analysis** (track the gene expression dynamics across temporal variations along the developmental stages)**Single-cell analysis** (identify cell-types in single-cell RNA-Seq); For AM-based deep mining, **Functional gene discovery** and **Pathway activity analysis** are provided to perform gene function prediction, gain biological insights into GWAS result, as well as active pathways, respectively. The easyMF project is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/cma2015/easyMF) and can be accessed from http://bioinfo.nwafu.edu.cn:4002.
