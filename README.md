## Introduction
- easyMF is a user-friendly web platform that aims to facilitate biological discovery from large-scale transcriptome data through matrix factorization (MF). By integrating three major matrix factorization algorithms (PCA [principle component analysis]; ICA [independent component analysis]; NMF [non-negative matrix factorization]), easyMF enables users perform a series of analysis based on pattern matrix (PM) and amplitude matrix (AM). For metagene-based deep mining using PM, four sub-modules are implemented to perform **Clustering analysis**, **Temporal-spatial transcriptome analysis**, **Single-cell analysis**; For metagene-based deep mining using AM, **Functional gene discovery** and **Pathway activity analysis** are provided to perform gene function prediction, and active pathways, respectively. The easyMF project is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/cma2015/easyMF) and can be accessed from (http://easymf.omicstudio.cloud/).
